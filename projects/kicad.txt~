1) thought about autorefresh after each graphic activity? - manual refresh is hassle.
2) cannot get wires to connect to pins - all marked unconnected - but appear to be connected at highest resolution.
3) CVpcb crashes after saving (possibly because library not in project folder?)
4) Module editor cannot delete module (when library is not in project folder) - gives message: Impossible to get permissions for file '/root/kicad/projects/library/ted_diodes.$$$' (error 2: No such file or directory) and another window Librariri.cpp: rename err 2

Reading in netlists
component j1 not found, etc - do I need to have the footprint name, or the module name, the .mod name, etc.?
